# Pedro Machado's Portfolio
[![Ask DeepWiki](https://devin.ai/assets/askdeepwiki.png)](https://deepwiki.com/Pedrohmac07/Portfolio-React)

This is the repository for my personal portfolio website, designed to showcase my skills and projects. It is a modern, single-page application built with Next.js, React, and TypeScript, featuring a host of interactive animations and visual effects.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Interactive Particle Background:** A dynamic WebGL particle background created with `ogl` that reacts to mouse movement.
- **Scroll-Triggered Animations:** Content sections elegantly fade and slide into view on scroll, powered by `Framer Motion`.
- **Dynamic "About Me" Section:** Features an interactive text effect (`TextPressure`) that responds to cursor proximity and a scrolling logo wall (`LogoLoop`) of technologies I've worked with.
- **Tabbed Project Showcase:** My projects are neatly organized into "Front-End" and "Back-End" categories, with data dynamically loaded from a local JSON file.
- **3D Profile Card:** A visually striking profile card with a tilt effect that responds to mouse movement, creating a 3D illusion.
- **Typed Introduction:** An engaging headline with an auto-typing animation using `react-typed`.
